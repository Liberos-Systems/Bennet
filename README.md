# yard
## About 
Yard is a tool like Yarn, but aimed at Linux projects in C/C++/Python/JavaScript, with GTK and various build systems.

## Goal
Yard is a tool designed for creating workspaces, managing packages, and building programs in various languages such as C/C++/Python/JavaScript. It supports different build systems like Meson and ultimately builds into popular package types like deb and rpm.

## Origin
Yard aims to build packages for Linux Mint and make their programming easy in a comfortable environment similar to Yarn. Once this goal is achieved, I will consider Yard 2, which will support the Gnome technology stack.
